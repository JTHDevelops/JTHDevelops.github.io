We've made some significant changes to the way we are operating our website. 
Firstly, we have moved from a google-hosted site to a jekyll based site
hosted on [Github Pages](http://github.io/){:target="_blank"}.

Building a jekyll based, blog oriented website is just the first of many
projets on deck for JTH Develops, and we look forward to impementing all of
these solutions in the coming 10 to 12 months.

As we progress throughout the next year on our journey down the great river
of fincancial success, we are eager to develop, not just the finest software
on the market, but also the finest community of clientelle in our little
corner of the internet.
