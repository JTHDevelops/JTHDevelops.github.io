At JTH Develops, even though we seek to build proprietary tools, we believe
strongly in the Free and Open-Sourced Software community.  We know that we
are only capable of building our business because of the hard work,
dedication, and attention to community of thousands of independent
developers who've come before us.  Because of this acknowledgement, we
participate in that community, and give back in whatever ways we can.  Below
is a list of the open source projects on which we are currently working.
